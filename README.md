# gfxDraw Arduino Drawing Library for Vector Graphics

There are various GFX libraries available in the Arduino Community that support many differend displays with
simple graphics can be drawn like lines, rectangles, circles and some more.

The gfxDraw library offers more advanced drawing capabilities with vectorized drawing by using a GFX library under the hood
for sending the output to the displays.

The functions are optimized for pixel oriented displays, do not implement antialiasing and have minimized use of float and arc arithmetics. This makes this library usable in microprocessor programming like ESP32 based boards with graphic displays.

The library supports up to 16 bit display resolutions and 32-bit (or less) colors.


## Drawing Primitives

The algorithms in this library include a collection of efficient basic drawing algorithms like the drawing approach of
bresenham for lines, bezier curves and arcs. These are availabe for drawing directly as they call a callBack function for every pixel that is part of the primitives:

```cpp
  gfxDraw::drawLine(5, 5, 10, 5, [&](int16_t x, int16_t y) {
    gfx->setPixel(x, y, WHITE); // hard-coded stroke color here.
  });

  gfxDraw::drawCubicBezier(10, 10, 11, 2, 25, 18, 26, 10, [&](int16_t x, int16_t y) {
    gfx->setPixel(x, y, YELLOW); // hard-coded stroke color here.
  });
```

These primitive can be combined as segments to create polygons and paths of complex drawings that can be open with 2
ends or closed.  Closed paths are given when the last element is a `Close` command `Z` that ensures the last point to be
equal to the first point of the path.

Path lines can also be drawn by using a primitive function:

```cpp
  gfxDraw::drawPath("M1 1 h7 v7 h-7 z M4 4 h1 v1 h-1 z", [&](int16_t x, int16_t y) {
    gfx->setPixel(x, y + 40, GREEN); // hard-coded stroke color here.
  });
```

This function will parse the given path definition and draws the border in GREEN color. This consumes a lot of cpu and all
intermediate computing and memory requirements will be allocated and freed during the call.


In the calback function the figure may be shifted by adding the offset to `x` and `y` and by providing a color to the gfy setPixel function.


## Path Syntax

To create a vector (array) of segments the `path` syntax from the SVG was chosen.  There are several helpful web sites
and tools to create such paths definitions like the [yqnn SVG Path Editor](https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/) ot
the [aydos SVG Path Editor](https://aydos.com/svgedit/).

Examples:

* Simple Line: `"M 0,0 L 30,40"`
* Rectange: `"M 10,10 h40 v30 h-40 z"`
* Bezier Curve: `"M16 12c5 0 5 7 0 7"`
* Smiley:
    `"M12,2h64c4,0 8,4 8,8v48c0,4 -4,8 -8,8h-64c-4,0 -8,-4 -8,-8v-48c0,-4 4,-8 8,-8z"`
    `"M12,10 h60v20h-60z"`
    `"M24,36c6,0 12,6 12,12 0,6 -6,12 -12,12-6,0 -12,-6 -12,-12 0,-6 6,-12 12,-12z"`


## Path as Segments

After parsing the path syntax a list (vector) of segments can be created as an interim result.  It is a binary
representation of the given path by using absolute coordinates only.  
To avoid repeated efforts of parsing the path can be parsed into a vector of segments upfront.  This also allows some
more control over drawing and creates some effectiveness when repeated drawing is required because parsing the path
syntax consumes time, cpu and memory resources.

These Segments can be modified to draw the path figure in different scales and rotations.

```cpp
  std::vector<Segment> segs = gfxDraw::parsePath("M1 1 h7 v7 h-7 z M4 4 h1 v1 h-1 z");

  gfxDraw::scaleSegments(segs, 300); // scale by 300%
  gfxDraw::rotateSegments(segs, 45); // rotate 45Â° clockwise

  gfxDraw::drawSegments(segs, [&](int16_t x, int16_t y) {
    gfx->setPixel(x, y, RED); // hard-coded stroke color here.
  });
```


## Filling a Path

There is also a function available that allows filling closed paths.
2 callback functions are required for drawing:

* The Border draw callback is used for drawing all border pixels.
* The Fill draw callback is used for drawing all inner pixels.

```cpp
  std::vector<Segment> segs = gfxDraw::parsePath("M1 1 h7 v7 h-7 z M4 4 h1 v1 h-1 z");

  gfxDraw::fillSegments(segs,
    [&](int16_t x, int16_t y) { gfx->setPixel(x, y, BLACK); }, // hard-coded stroke color here.
    [&](int16_t x, int16_t y) { gfx->setPixel(x, y, WHITE); }); // hard-coded fill color here.
```

When no Border draw callback is provided the Fill draw callback will also be used for the border pixels.

The implementation of fillSegments will use a filling algorithm described in detail below.

The pixel order of the callback functions is y-line oriented and therefore different to the order from the drawSegments
function.


## Transforming based on Segments

Segment vectors can be transformed in place by the following algorithms:

gfxDraw::scaleSegments -- This function scales all points and radius values by the given factor.  The factor is given in
percentages so `100` will not scale when given as input.

gfxDraw::moveSegments -- This function adds a vector (dx, dy) to all points in the segments.  The offset factor is given
in pixels.

gfxDraw::rotateSegments -- This function ...

gfxDraw::transformSegments -- This function ... callback for all points in the segments.


```cpp
  std::vector<Segment> segs = gfxDraw::parsePath("M1 1 h7 v7 h-7 z M4 4 h1 v1 h-1 z");

  gfxDraw::scaleSegments(segs, 200); // scale by 200%

  gfxDraw::fillSegments(segs,
    [&](int16_t x, int16_t y) { gfx->setPixel(x, y, BLACK); }, // hard-coded stroke color here.
    [&](int16_t x, int16_t y) { gfx->setPixel(x, y, WHITE); }); // hard-coded fill color here.
```

## Elliptical Arc Curve Command

The [elliptical arc curve command](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/paths.html#PathDataEllipticalArcCommands) as defined by
the specification enables drawing curves from circles and ecliptics.

Drawing these usually needs much trigonometric computation and the
[arc reference implementation notes](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/implnote.html#ArcImplementationNotes) from the W3C standard also
includes several rules how to deal with the parameters.
