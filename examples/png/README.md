# gfxDraw PNG Test program

This example is not to be used in the Arduino environment.

Here you can find a implementation for using the library by a windows executable to produce several png files with test
images.

This example is especially helpful while engineering the library with fast turn-around cycles and debugging
capabilities.

To use this example as-is you have to setup a Visual Studio environment for compiling c / c++.  See
[Configure VS Code for Microsoft C++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc)

The png file functions where taken from the PNG encoder and decoder implementation at
[PNG encoder and decoder in C and C++](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng)
